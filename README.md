# Visualize Changes in Sea Ice Concentration using an EUMETSAT Dataset from the Copernicus Climate Data Store
This contribution contains a MATLAB Live Script file that illustrates 
how to obtain and use data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store 
(https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) to map sea ice concentration in the 
northern hemisphere from 1978 to 2014. 

The dataset was produced at the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite 
Application Facility (OSI SAF) as Global Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data 
Records (1978-2015). The dataset is available for download from the 
Copernicus Climate Data Store as well as the EUMETSAT OSI SAF webportal,
(http://osisaf.met.no/p/ice/index.html) in Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) 
file format.

The example visualizes the annual changes in sea ice concentration using
2D surface and contour maps and as contours on a 3D globe.

### Software Requirements
MATLAB and Mapping Toolbox are required to run the Live Script file.
